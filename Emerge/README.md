# Emerge

`Emerge` is the agent orchestration and execution package behind EMERGE-Policy. It turns a user instruction into a stateful embodied-agent run by combining an LLM, workspace context, specialist sub-agents, robot tools, memory, and a versioned runtime protocol.

The package does not own the simulator or robot process. Those components live under `robot/` and exchange state and actions with Emerge through a shared workspace.

The TUI and headless CLI are clients of the same `AgentRuntime`. They therefore use the same configuration, workspace lock, agent loop, event model, cancellation rules, and cleanup behavior.

## Main capabilities

- Stateful tool-using agent loop with context-window management and persistent sessions.
- Workspace-based robot coordination through explicit state, plan, observation, and action files.
- Geometry-driven motion primitives plus model-policy execution through either VLA or WAM.
- Dedicated object-localization and task-verification sub-agents with isolated contexts and tools.
- Continuous visual monitoring that can interrupt a running robot action when its visible subgoal is achieved.
- Interactive full-screen terminal UI for human operation.
- Versioned JSON request, event, and result contracts for evaluation and automation.
- Provider routing for hosted APIs, OAuth providers, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and local deployments.

## Installation

Install the project from the repository root:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Python 3.10 or later is required. Robot environments, external model servers, checkpoints, and evaluation dependencies are documented in the repository-level README and the guides under `scripts/`.

## First launch

Start Emerge directly:

```bash
emerge
```

On first launch, follow the prompts to select a provider, enter a model ID, and
configure your API address and credentials. For visual robot tasks, choose a
model with image input and tool calling.

Default paths:

```text
~/.Emerge/config.json
~/.Emerge/workspace/
```

Use `--config` for a different configuration file or `--workspace` for a different
workspace.

Inspect the active paths, model, and provider state with:

```bash
emerge workspace status
```

## Configuration

Configuration files use camelCase keys. A compact configuration looks like this:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "workspace": "~/.Emerge/workspace",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
      "provider": "auto",
      "maxTokens": 8192,
      "contextWindowTokens": 65536,
      "temperature": 0.1,
      "maxToolIterations": 40
    }
  },
  "visualMonitor": {
    "enabled": true,
    "pollIntervalSeconds": 0.5,
    "verificationTimeoutSeconds": 30.0,
    "confirmations": 1
  },
  "subagents": {
    "objectLocation": {
      "model": null,
      "timeout": 120.0,
      "maxIterations": 8
    },
    "taskVerification": {
      "model": null,
      "maxIterations": 2
    }
  },
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY"
    }
  },
  "tools": {
    "restrictToWorkspace": false,
    "exec": {
      "timeout": 60,
      "pathAppend": ""
    }
  }
}
```

When a specialist sub-agent has no model override, it uses the main agent model. Set `tools.restrictToWorkspace` to `true` when file and shell access must remain inside the configured workspace.

The provider registry supports Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Azure OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, Groq, DashScope, Moonshot, MiniMax, Zhipu, AiHubMix, SiliconFlow, VolcEngine, custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, vLLM, Ollama, OpenAI Codex OAuth, and GitHub Copilot OAuth. With `provider` set to `auto`, Emerge resolves the provider from the model prefix and configured credentials.

OAuth login commands are:

```bash
emerge provider login openai-codex
emerge provider login github-copilot
```

## Interactive client

Start the full-screen terminal client:

```bash
emerge
```

Optional overrides apply to the runs started by that client:

```bash
emerge \
  --config ~/.Emerge/config.json \
  --workspace ~/.Emerge/workspace \
  --session cli:demo \
  --model anthropic/claude-opus-4-5
```

Type `/` in an empty prompt to open the command palette. Available operations include starting a new session, resuming a saved session, changing the model, stopping a run, checking service health, viewing logs, toggling tool details, inspecting workspace paths, exporting the conversation, and viewing recent run artifacts.

Drag over conversation text to select it; releasing the mouse copies the
selection. Use the mouse wheel or `PageUp` / `PageDown` to scroll. `Ctrl+C`
copies selected text; with no selection, it stops the current run or exits.
Press `Esc` to clear the selection and return to typing.

### Reload the environment with `/reset`

With `robot.controller` running against the same workspace, enter `/reset` in
Emerge. This also works during a task: Emerge stops the Agent and waits for robot
action cancellation before asking the controller to close its driver. Once the
controller confirms it has stopped writing, Emerge clears the task workspace,
starts a new session with the selected model, and lets the controller recreate
the environment. Both terminals remain running; the old task is not resumed.

The cleanup matches `/new`: clear `EMBODIED.md`, `ROBOT_STATE.md`, `PLAN.md`,
`memory/MEMORY.md` and the action queue, then delete and recreate `artifacts/`.
Session and run history, other memory files, and `.controller/` are retained.
The new environment installs its profile and publishes fresh state and enabled
observations. Recordings reuse their configured paths and existing overwrite
behavior. `/new` continues to clear the workspace without reloading the environment.

If stopping is unconfirmed or the controller does not accept the request, reset
aborts before cleanup; cancellation flags remain set. If loading fails after
cleanup, the new session is retained and the error is displayed. Correct the
driver configuration and enter `/reset` again. While a claimed request's result
is unconfirmed, Emerge keeps checking that request and blocks new tasks and
duplicate resets. It never automatically repeats cleanup or loading.

The controller rereads the original `--driver-config` on each reload. For the
LIBERO driver, the controller workspace also determines where camera artifacts
are written. Recreating the driver does not reload Python source or clear module
caches.

### Switch scenes with `/scene`

Configure the scene root and the initial file separately in the driver JSON:

```json
{
  "libero": {
    "bddl_root": "third_party/openpi/third_party/libero/libero/libero/bddl_files",
    "bddl_file_name": "libero_object/pick_up_the_cream_cheese_and_place_it_in_the_basket.bddl"
  }
}
```

`bddl_file_name` is relative to `bddl_root`. Relative roots are resolved from
the Controller's working directory. Existing configs without `bddl_root` still
accept a full BDDL path and use its parent as the browsing root.

With the LIBERO controller running, choose `/scene` from the `/` menu to browse
`bddl_root`. Type to filter, use the arrow keys to select, and press Enter to
open a directory or load a `.bddl` file. Select `../` to go up, stopping at the
configured root; Esc closes the list. The current scene is marked, and selecting
it leaves the environment as it is. Each new `/scene` starts at the root.

Switching stops the current task and waits for action cancellation, clears the
task workspace using the cleanup scope above, then loads the selected BDDL and
starts a new session. The sidebar displays the loaded scene. This is a separate
operation from `/reset`; it does not edit the driver configuration. If loading
fails, the environment stays unavailable and `/scene` can select another file
under the configured root to retry.

Restart both the TUI and Controller once after updating to this version so they
use the new scene control protocol. Subsequent scene switches keep both running.

## External model services

`/health` discovers self-described services on local ports 8000–8099, including
OpenPI, Cosmos, VGGT, SAM3, and future models. It shows the actual service name,
endpoint, and readiness; `/details` also shows the model and instance ID.
Only the configured local port range is scanned.

Optional configuration (camelCase and snake_case keys are accepted):

```json
{
  "modelServices": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "startPort": 8000,
    "endPort": 8099,
    "concurrency": 16,
    "connectTimeout": 0.5,
    "endpointTimeout": 2,
    "scanTimeout": 15
  },
  "subagents": {
    "objectLocation": {}
  }
}
```

Discovery selects a unique matching local instance for each requested service;
multiple matches are reported as an error. The selected endpoint is retained by
the client, not silently changed after failures. Discovery doesn't rewrite
configuration. Policy driver configuration accepts an optional `model_id` and a
`discovery` object using the snake_case discovery settings above.

Public clients and servers must be upgraded together. Old plain-text health
and old inference messages are not accepted. A timed-out or disconnected
request isn't automatically replayed: the backend may already have executed it.
See the [service guide](../scripts/model_server/README.md) and
[adapter guide](../external_model_server/README.md).

## Headless runtime

Use the headless client for evaluations, scripts, and other machine integrations:

```bash
python -m Emerge.cli.headless \
  "Put the red block in the basket" \
  --workspace ~/.Emerge/workspace \
  --session eval:episode-001 \
  --timeout-s 600
```

It writes exactly one `RunResult` JSON object to standard output. Diagnostics go to standard error. Unless `--output-dir` is provided, artifacts are stored under:

```text
<workspace>/runs/<run_id>/
├── request.json
├── events.jsonl
├── result.json
└── runtime.log
```

A request file can provide the versioned contract directly:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "Emerge.run_request.v1",
  "run_id": "episode_001",
  "session_id": "eval:episode-001",
  "message": "Put the red block in the basket",
  "workspace": "/absolute/path/to/workspace",
  "timeout_s": 600,
  "cancel_timeout_s": 10,
  "stream": true,
  "metadata": {
    "suite": "libero"
  }
}
```

Run it with:

```bash
python -m Emerge.cli.headless --request request.json
```

`RunResult.run_status` is one of `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `timed_out`. Cancellation data acknowledges whether physical execution was stopped; it is not a benchmark success signal.

Only one runtime may own a workspace at a time. `WorkspaceLease` prevents concurrent writers from issuing conflicting robot actions or mutating the same run state.

## Agent context and workspace contract

The workspace is the boundary between language-level reasoning and the robot controller. The runtime creates missing templates before a run, while preserving existing files.

| Path | Owner and purpose |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | User-maintained instructions for the main agent |
| `EMBODIED.md` | Active robot capabilities and action conventions |
| `ROBOT_STATE.md` | Controller-written robot runtime state |
| `PLAN.md` | Agent-maintained task plan and progress |
| `ACTION.md` | Action queue shared by the agent and controller |
| `memory/MEMORY.md` | Consolidated long-term memory |
| `artifacts/observations/observation.json` | Current multi-camera observation manifest |
| `sessions/*.jsonl` | Persistent conversation histories |
| `runs/<run_id>/` | Structured headless run artifacts |
| `skills/` | Optional workspace-local skills |

At the start of a turn, the context builder combines the active instructions, robot state, plan, memory, and relevant skills. The agent must re-read `ROBOT_STATE.md` after each physical action because the copy included in its original context becomes stale as soon as the controller moves the robot.

## Tools and skills

The main agent registers these tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_dir` | Inspect and update workspace files |
| `exec` | Run a shell command with configured timeout and path policy |
| `update_plan` | Update protected plan state safely |
| `message` | Emit a concise progress message |
| `delegate_subagent` | Run a registered specialist sub-agent |
| `execute_robot_action` | Validate, enqueue, monitor, and await a robot action |

Built-in skills define operating procedures for planning, progress reporting, memory, object localization, task verification, geometric attachment, VLA control, and WAM control. Workspace-local skills can be added under `<workspace>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

### Robot action backends

`execute_robot_action` always exposes geometry-driven actions such as `move_to_pose`, `move_linear`, `set_gripper`, and `follow_arc`. A run may additionally enable one model-policy backend:

```bash
EMERGE_POLICY_BACKEND=vla   # enables vla_execute
EMERGE_POLICY_BACKEND=wam   # enables wam_execute
```

The evaluation launcher normally sets this variable. When a backend is selected, the other model-policy action is rejected, while geometry-driven actions remain available.

For VLA, the agent provides a phase-local natural-language instruction and a step budget. For WAM, the agent provides the next unfinished contact phase; the evaluator separately supplies and locks the task-conditioning mode and full task instruction.

Each accepted action is appended to `ACTION.md`. The controller executes it, updates its status, and refreshes `ROBOT_STATE.md`. The tool waits for a terminal action result and participates in runtime cancellation, so a run cannot report clean completion while robot actions remain active.

## Specialist sub-agents

### Object location

The `object_location` sub-agent locates movable objects, destinations, obstacles, and visible task-relevant fixtures from calibrated camera views. Its private tool chain is:

```text
observe_scene
      -> segment_candidates (SAM3 + cached VGGT geometry)
      -> visual candidate verification
      -> locate_candidates (multi-view world-frame result)
```

It reads `artifacts/observations/observation.json`, compares plausible candidates across the enabled views, segments them, rejects inconsistent masks using calibrated-view consensus, and returns compact world-frame positions, dimensions, orientations, and scene context. Internal prompts, masks, residuals, and point-cloud diagnostics remain private to the sub-agent.

Run it directly for diagnosis:

```bash
python -m Emerge.subagents.object_location.main \
  --task "Locate the salad dressing"
```

### Task verification

The `task_verification` sub-agent inspects current multi-camera images after an action. It decomposes the requested result into visible predicates and submits an `achieved`, `not_achieved`, or `uncertain` result with evidence. It does not control the robot and does not require VGGT or SAM3.

Run it directly for diagnosis:

```bash
python -m Emerge.subagents.task_verification.main \
  --task "Verify that the apple is inside the basket and released"
```

### Visual monitor

When enabled, the visual monitor observes action progress independently of the main reasoning loop. It uses the current plan, action, and camera observations to detect visible subgoal completion. A confirmed result can request an early stop for the active action, after which the main agent resumes from freshly written robot state.

## Sessions and memory

Each run has a `session_id`. Messages are persisted in the workspace so the TUI or a later headless request can resume the same conversation. When the prompt approaches `contextWindowTokens`, the memory subsystem consolidates older information into long-term memory instead of relying on an unbounded message history.

Run token usage in `RunResult` currently covers the main agent. Specialist sub-agent usage is not included in that field.

## External services

Emerge connects to external services but does not launch them from inside the package:

- The robot or simulator controller consumes `ACTION.md`, writes results, updates `ROBOT_STATE.md`, and publishes observations.
- The object-location sub-agent discovers VGGT and SAM3 by their service contracts.
- VLA and WAM inference are executed by the active controller integration and their model servers.

Use the repository scripts under `scripts/model_server/` and the evaluation guides under `scripts/` to start the required service combination for a task.

## Extension points

- **Main-agent tool:** implement `Tool` under `agent/tools/` and register it in `AgentLoop._register_default_tools()`.
- **Main-agent skill:** add `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, or install it only for one workspace under `<workspace>/skills/`.
- **Specialist sub-agent:** provide an isolated agent, context builder, skill registry, tool registry, and `register.py`, then add the assembled instance to the main `SubagentRegistry`.
- **Provider:** add a `ProviderSpec`, a matching configuration field, and a provider implementation when the LiteLLM adapter is insufficient.
- **Runtime client:** construct `RunRequest`, call `AgentRuntime.run()`, and consume `RunEvent` callbacks and the final `RunResult`.
- **Workspace protocol:** add a template and explicitly load or consume it in the context builder, agent tool, or controller.

When this document and the implementation disagree, the current code is authoritative.
